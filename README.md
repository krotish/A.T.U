# DevOps Technical Test for A.T.U

## Background

This Vagrant profile uses Ansible to configure a local VM with Docker, then it uses Ansible to build and run three containers for a simple PHP Guestbook web app:

  - `guestbook-app`: PHP Guestbook web app container.
  - `redis`: Redis in-memory data structure store container.
  - `nginx`: Nginx web server.

## Getting Started

To use the vagrant file, you will need to have done the following:

  1. Download and Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  2. Download and Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  3. Install [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html)
  4. Open a shell prompt (Terminal app on a Mac) and cd into the folder containing the `Vagrantfile`
  5. Run the following command to install the necessary Ansible roles for this profile: `$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

Once all of that is done, you can simply type in `vagrant up`, and Vagrant will create a new VM, install the base box, and configure it.

Once the new VM is up and running (after `vagrant up` is complete and you're back at the command prompt), you can log into it via SSH if you'd like by typing in `vagrant ssh`. Otherwise, the next steps are below.

### Setting up your hosts file

You need to modify your host machine's hosts file (Mac/Linux: `/etc/hosts`; Windows: `%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`), adding the line below:

    192.168.33.39  guestbook.dev

After that is configured, you could visit http://guestbook.dev/ in a browser, and you'll see the test page generated by Nginx.
